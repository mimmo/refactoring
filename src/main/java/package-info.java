/**
 * First exercise on refactoring from Fowler's book. Do not forget to write tests.
 * If you don't already have our custom preferences, ask for that.
 *
 * Keep in mind the following shortcuts, they may be useful:
 * 		- ctrl + 1 : help from eclipse, either to solve errors and to auto-complete 
 * 					 (use it when writing a new method as well as to complete the variables names)
 * 					 e.g. syso AND crtl + 1 => System.out.println();
 * 					 e.g. test4 AND crtl + 1 => test method declaration
 *
 * 		- ctrl + e : to focus an already open class
 * 		- ctrl + h : to search for strings in the workspace 
 * 		- ctrl + shift + r : to open a resource  
 * 		- ctrl + shift + t : to open a new java class 
 * 		- ctrl + shift + g : to see who calls the method/class
 * 		
 *		- alt + shift + r : to rename variables/classes/packages 
 * 		- alt + shift + s : to open the source menu - generate getter/setter and constructor
 * 		- alt + shift + t : to open the refactor menu - moving out method/class
